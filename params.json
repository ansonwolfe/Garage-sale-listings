What I thought would have been a quick, one day thing turned out to be a week-long project.  \r\n\r\nIronically, the main things I wanted to sell all got sold before I completed this. I'd like to add Twilio, phone-SMS to this for next batch of things I want to sell.\r\n\r\nStack used:\r\n- Ruby on Rails\r\n- Paperclip gem\r\n- Amazon S3 web services (to host images)\r\n- Heroku\r\n- smidget of site tracking via MixPanel","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
